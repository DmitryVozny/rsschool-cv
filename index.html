    <p>At the moment I have skills in semantic, adaptive and cross-browser layout, I write my code in JS to “revive”
      sites. During my studies, I worked with Git, used the Gulp builder, used CSS animations and ready-made libraries
      (GreenSock). I am constantly learning (currently mastering the Vue framework) and improving my knowledge and
      skills.<br>
      About me: After graduating from university, I successfully worked in my specialty until November 2022.<br> I got
      tired of constant business trips and decided to change my profession to front-end development. Since January 23, I
      began to study this profession independently and in various courses. I chose the direction of front-end
      development because I like to look at the results of my work, and then use them as a regular user, modifying and
      introducing new features. During my studies, I implemented several pet projects, which you can see on my Github
      account.</p>

Skills: At the moment I have skills in semantic, adaptive and cross-browser layout, I write my code in JS to “revive” sites. During my studies, I worked with Git, used the Gulp builder, used CSS animations and ready-made libraries (GreenSock). I am constantly learning (currently mastering the Vue framework) and improving my knowledge and skills.<br>
About me: After graduating from university, I successfully worked in my specialty until November 2022.<br> I got tired of constant business trips and decided to change my profession to front-end development. Since January 23, I began to study this profession independently and in various courses. I chose front-end development because I like to see the results of my work,During my studies, I implemented several pet projects, which you can see on my Github account.<br>
